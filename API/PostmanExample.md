# API testing with Postman Example
This file will preview the example of my API testing with Postman.
What I have studied from bootcamp and other API's example testing :
- use postman in various platform: Website, desktop application and VScode's extension.
- use the common commands/requests in Postman (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DEL )
- know how to get the API KEY to access and get through the authentication.
- add variables/environments and essential tests for each request.
- RUN manual and automated test for each collection/request.
- Use and edit SNIPPETS in TESTS to get TEST RESULTS

I also add the JSON files if you want to examine more deeply about this API project [Link to my files]()

Here's some of the example:

## Collection : myReqresAPI

1) Use GET request to get list user
![pm1]()
2) GET test results
4) POST to create a user
![pm3](https://github.com/jijdp/portfolio-details/assets/138129390/d50d40d0-0ccd-4a41-a628-fcd79e45db72)
5) POST test results
6) PUT to edit user 1
