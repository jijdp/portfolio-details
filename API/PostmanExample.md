# API testing with Postman Example
## This file will preview the example of my API testing with Postman.
What I have studied from bootcamp and other API's example testing :
- use postman in various platform: Website, desktop application and VScode's extension.
- use the common commands/requests in Postman (Get, Post, Put, Patch, Del )
- know how to get the API's Key to access and get through the authentication.
- add variables/environments and essential tests for each request.
- run manual and automated test for each collection/request.
I also add the JSON files if you want to examine deeply what can I do with API Postman

Here's some of the example:
