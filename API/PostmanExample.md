# API testing with Postman Example
This file will preview the example of my API testing with Postman.
What I have studied from bootcamp and other tester's API testing projects :
- use postman in various platform: Website, desktop application and VScode's extension.
- use the common commands/requests in Postman (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DEL )
- know how to get the API Key and TOKEN to access and get through the authentication.
- add variables/environments and essential tests for each request.
- RUN manual and automated test for each collection/request.
- Use and edit SNIPPETS in TESTS to get TEST RESULTS

I also add the JSON files if you want to examine more deeply about these API project
