# API testing with Postman Example
This file will preview the example of my API testing with Postman.
What I have studied from bootcamp and other API's example testing :
- use postman in various platform: Website, desktop application and VScode's extension.
- use the common commands/requests in Postman (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DEL )
- know how to get the API KEY to access and get through the authentication.
- add variables/environments and essential tests for each request.
- RUN manual and automated test for each collection/request.
- Use and edit SNIPPETS in TESTS to get TEST RESULTS

I also add the JSON files if you want to examine deeply this API project

Here's some of the example:

## Collection : myReqresAPI

1) Use GET request to get list user

2) GET Test result
3) POST to create a user
