# Writing test case and test scenario with Trello Example
This file will show how I use Trello from studied Bootcamp course:
- Create a board

- Write Test Scenarios and Test Cases for these functionality
  - Regsitration / Sign up for mobile application
  - Regsitration / Sign up for Facebook website
  - Search functionality for Udemy website

adapt and edit to be more suitable for Thai app and Thai user (such as country code in phone number)
